Removing them completely is an involved process, though. They really want to make sure you are intentional and know the consequences.

While doing some reading with the latest preparation materials from Cambridge Press, I found highlighting relevant parts the most helpful strategy for me. It becomes easier to navigate a text with every other highlighted piece. As the result, I make 1-2 mistakes instead of 4-6 without it. I was lucky to find an application of Pareto principle to my work here.</description></item><item><title>Mock Ielts Results</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 03:40:02 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts-results/</guid><description>Well, the results came in, 7.5-6-7-7 üôÇ To be honest, I‚Äôm pretty happy because I just went for it without any preparation.
