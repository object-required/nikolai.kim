While I enjoy the platform, I don&amp;rsquo;t really use anything but a custom domain feature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clean Slate</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/clean-slate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 09:52:47 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/clean-slate/</guid><description>Over time, I created and abandoned many repositories on GitHub. Removing them completely is an involved process, though. They really want to make sure you are intentional and know the consequences.
Of course, this is great, but not when you need to delete a dozen of projects. That&amp;rsquo;s 6 times more clicks!
Here is the solution I came up with — https://clean-slate.surge.sh It allows selecting multiple repositories and deleting them without confirmations.</description></item><item><title>Monthly Subscription</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/monthly-subscription/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 21:26:21 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/monthly-subscription/</guid><description>Every time my sends a payment notification, I remember I have a blog.

Now that Russia is nearly declaring a state of war, instead of a “special military operation” it becomes a top priority to make sure my family is safe 🙏</description></item><item><title>Monochrome</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/monochrome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 23:34:50 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/monochrome/</guid><description>I recall someone said that monochrome picture is less attractive for human eye.

While doing some reading with the latest preparation materials from Cambridge Press, I found highlighting relevant parts the most helpful strategy for me. It becomes easier to navigate a text with every other highlighted piece. As the result, I make 1-2 mistakes instead of 4-6 without it. I was lucky to find an application of Pareto principle to my work here.</description></item><item><title>Mock Ielts Results</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 03:40:02 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts-results/</guid><description>Well, the results came in, 7.5-6-7-7 🙂 To be honest, I’m pretty happy because I just went for it without any preparation. Now the plan is to fix Reading and make other “lucky” 7s more “confident”.</description></item><item><title>Mock IELTS</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 02:43:52 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/mock-ielts/</guid><description>Today I took a mock IELTS. It looks like I will need at least 6.5 for all sections except Listening, which should be 7.5. The results should come in 48 hours, so now I’m just waiting 😴</description></item><item><title>Good Morning</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/good-morning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 12:12:51 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/good-morning/</guid><description>It looks even more hazy in person

You may even be grateful for them, as they helped you carry on until now… 😇 Once you came up with a better one, you won’t feel any resistance adopting new behaviour ✨ Or even solve the issue once and for all 💪</description></item><item><title>Oh, hi there</title><link>https://nikolai.kim/posts/oh-hi-there/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:49:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://nikolai.kim/posts/oh-hi-there/</guid><description>This would be my first post on Micro.blog platform 🥳 I had successfully wasted my trial period, but I can feel a great adventure ahead!
