You shouldnâ€™t attempt eliminating bad habits because they are imperfect solutions to a problem you experience. You may even be grateful for them, as they helped you carry on until nowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‡ Once you came up with a better one, you wonâ€™t feel any resistance adopting new behaviour âœ¨ Or even solve the issue once and for all ðŸ’ª
