Over time, I created and abandoned many repositories on GitHub. Removing them completely is an involved process, though. They really want to make sure you are intentional and know the consequences.

Of course, this is great, but not when you need to delete a dozen of projects. That's 6 times more clicks!

Here is the solution I came up with — https://clean-slate.surge.sh It allows selecting multiple repositories and deleting them without confirmations. Dangerous 😈

Source code is available on GitHub as well, so you can be sure it doesn't do anything weird or unexpected.
